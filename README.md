# ProjDodge
A small game made for the Sense HAT

This is just a small project me and a friend made in our spare time. The main code was done in one day, also the first day I used Python so it might not be the cleanest, although I have cleaned it up a lot and added features since the first day.

## Controls
The joystick is currently the only method to control the player (or the arrow keys if you are on an emulator)

## Stages
There are multiples stages as you play.
#### 1. Initial stage
* Four projectiles > small player > slow projectiles
#### 2. Second
* Five projectiles > small player > slow projectiles
#### 3. Third
* Five projectiles > large player > slow projectiles
#### 4. Fourth
* Six projectiles > large player > slow projectiles
#### 5. Fifth
* Six projectiles > large player > medium projectiles
#### 6. Sixth
* Six projectiles > large player > fast projectiles

If you do not have a Sense HAT, you can still play with the lin below:
